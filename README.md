 ðŸŒŒ 3D Solar System Project Overview
My project is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Three.js library. It features a realistic representation of the Sun and eight planets, each accurately scaled and colored. The planets orbit the Sun, and users can interact with the system through various controls.

ðŸ”­ Key Features
Realistic Planetary Orbits: Each planet follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, demonstrating orbital mechanics.

Interactive Controls: Users can zoom in and out, reset the view, and toggle the visibility of orbits and labels.

Informative Popups: Clicking on a planet displays a popup with details such as diameter, orbital period, and fun facts.

Responsive Design: The visualization adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices.

ðŸŽ¯ Educational Value
This project serves as an engaging educational tool, helping users understand the structure and dynamics of our solar system. By interacting with the 3D model, learners can better grasp concepts like planetary motion, relative sizes, and distances.
